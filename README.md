This Python 3 script does matrix multiplication on 2 matrices. The input matrices should be rows of space-seperated integers.  Two examples are provided along with the script.

To run this script, clone it, navigate to it on your terminal, and run `python3 matmul.py array1.txt array2.txt`.

This script requires NumPy. If you do not have this library installed, run `pip3 install numpy` before running the script.
